  TypeScript has won the hearts and minds of programmers all around the world. Unfortunately, your deadlines are due yesterday, your boss is unconvinced, and your team remains skeptical. What's a TypeScript enthusiast to do? Join me on a journey of self-discovery: we'll learn what it means to lead by influence and level up our effectiveness as engineers. Then, an exploration of the value to engineering and business brought about by type systems (with some math to prove it).
