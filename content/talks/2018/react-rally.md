title: Learning to Love Type Systems
conference: React Rally
kind: talk
location: Salt Lake City, UT
abstract: >-
  Sometimes, undefined is not a function. As mortal programmers, we ship bugs to production everyday. Bugs slow us down, frustrate our users, and cause us to have crises of confidence. Don't go aloneâ€“type systems in TypeScript, Flow, and GraphQL can improve your confidence and help you ship less bugs. We'll start with why: a practical look at what you'll get from embracing types. Then, a gentle introduction to the ideas behind them. Finally, we'll explore the possibilities of a type system over the network.
