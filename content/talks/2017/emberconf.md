  Addons are one of the best things about the Ember eco-system. With one command, you can opt into using a well tested addon that does some of the heavy-lifting for you when building complex applications. The next best thing is that sharing your solution for solving problems is very simple; it's not a big leap going from Ember developer to addon author!

  A healthy addon eco-system is one of the key strengths of Ember, and in this talk we'll discover some best practices, tips and tricks and other exciting confessions from a self-confessed addon addict!
