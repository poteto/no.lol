title: From Front End to Full Stack
conference: Erlang and Elixir Factory
kind: talk
location: San Francisco, CA
abstract: >-
  Starting out as a self-taught designer, learning front end development was a challenging climb â€“ but going from front end to full stack with Elixir and Phoenix was easier than many would expect. Having built a well-tested Phoenix API from the ground up, I'll narrate the adventure of learning to think the "Elixir Way", and reflect on lessons learned.

  In this beginner-friendly talk, we'll talk about overcoming the temptation of bringing over OOP practices into Elixir, harnessing the power of Plugs, techniques for testing, and more!
