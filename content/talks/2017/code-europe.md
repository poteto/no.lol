title: Monoliths to Services with Elixir & Phoenix
conference: Code Europe
kind: talk
location: Warsaw & Wrocław, Poland
abstract: >-
  Transitioning monolithic apps into a micro-service architecture isn't straightforward – in fact, it is often quite difficult. In this intermediate talk, we'll learn how Elixir umbrella apps and Phoenix utilize the Erlang VM (BEAM) to make building services less painful and more productive.
