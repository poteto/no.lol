title: Declarative Templating in Ember.js
conference: Øredev
kind: talk
location: Malmö, Sweden
abstract: >-
  In Ember, Handlebars is a small, Lisp-y templating language we use to express our application's user interface. We use Keywords, Helpers and Components and other primitives to build upon this language, and the result of this is a larger vocabulary in which we can declare our intent much more clearly. Let's explore how Keywords and Helpers augment Handlebars, and cover techniques and patterns for creating our own Helpers in good taste.

  In this talk, we'll cover everything from the Rule of Least Power, declarative templating, as well as patterns and anti-patterns of creating helpers.
