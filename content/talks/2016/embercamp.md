title: I Can Write My App with no Handlebars
conference: EmberCamp
kind: talk
location: London, United Kingdom
abstract: >-
  In Ember, Handlebars is a small, Lisp-y language we use to express our application's user interface. We use Keywords, Helpers and Components and other primitives to build upon this language, and the result of this is a larger vocabulary in which we can declare our intent much more clearly. Let's explore how Keywords and Helpers augment Handlebars, and cover techniques and patterns for creating our own Helpers in good taste.
