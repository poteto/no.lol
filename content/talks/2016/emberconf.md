title: "Idiomatic Ember: Finding the Sweet Spot of Performance & Productivity"
conference: EmberConf
kind: talk
location: Portland, OR
abstract: >-
  With the release of Ember 2.0, many best practices established in the 1.x series are unfortunately no longer relevant. Lessons learnt from the React and Flux communities can help guide the path toward The Ember Way, with "Data Down, Actions Up" being one of the core philosophies.

  In this talk, we'll discuss patterns and anti-patterns for bringing Ember applications into the 2.x paradigm, and discover how ideas from Functional Programming and game rendering engines can inform us. We will also look at the roads ahead to see what future versions of Ember will bring.
